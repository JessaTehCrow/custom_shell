## Why use it

This shell is made with customization and functionality in mind.
It allows you to add new commands, change the look of your shell and a lot more within seconds!


### Why i made it

I made this because i personally really didn't like the default windows command prompt.
So i decided i'd make my own shell that'll be more customizable AND look better.
This is my third time making a shell, and with that also the best version. 


## TODO

- Fix and add more documentation
- Fix color bug when typing in a backslash
- Find more bugs so i can fix them
- Add GIT auto update-detector
- Add highlighting and suggestion when a new command is added using `modules refresh`
