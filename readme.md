# Custom shell

This custom shell is a python alternative for your standard windows cmd.
It has custom modules, easy usage and easily customizable.

## Why

**Why you would want to use it**

It looks better and has better customizability. That's really all i can say 

**Why i made it**

I made this because i personally really didn't like the default windows command prompt.
So i decided i'd make my own shell that'll be more customizable AND look better.
This is my third time making a shell, and with that also the best version. 

## Examples
